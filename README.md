[Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)-Based [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) in an Object-Oriented Style
----------------------------------------

The first commit of this repository is a copy of the TodoMVC
[example code](https://github.com/rackt/redux) in the Redux repository.

In later commits the business logic (state representation, actions,
reducers) is transformed to an object-oriented style.
